#A1Z26

The A1Z26 code is a very simple code. As you know there are 26 letters in the American alphabet so Z would equal 26 because it is the 26th letter in the alphabet.

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

#Rot Cipher

*The Rot Cipher is when you take a letter and put it back or fourth to equal a different letter. An example of this would be -1 equals A=Z. +1 equals A+B It is Related to the Caesar Cipher.

*This is a Print out of the Rot Cipher Wheel. Cut out the 2 circles leaving the inner circle NOT HOLLOW. Then you stick a tack or a paper clip through the middle of the inner wheel. Then you can spin it around to do your cipher.
#Vigenere Cipher

The Vigenere Cipher is a 26x26 grid of letters a-z. It is a more complicated cipher so I will have to try to demonstrate with explaining battle ship.

Directions

1. Choose a code word (any word. no numbers)

2. Write it like this (my code word will be "code") i m t r y i n g t o e x p l a i n h o w t o d o t h i s it doesn't matter if the code word cant fit evenly c o d e c o d e c o d e c o d e c o d e c o d e c o d e

3. Look at the grid and follow the row i and the column c to the intersection like in battle ship. the letter they intersect on is k. that is how you encode it. To decode it take the code letter in this case c and go until you find k. Then go up all the way so you will find i.
